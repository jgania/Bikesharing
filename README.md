# Bikesharing

## Overview

The purpose of this assignment is to use Tableau to analyze the publicly available Citi Bike data and determine if a bike-share company idea could work in Des Moines. The assignment aims to develop critical thinking skills and data analysis expertise to determine which data will and will not apply to Des Moines. The assignment also emphasizes the importance of presenting data accurately and reducing personal bias to ensure honesty and integrity in data science. The specific tasks include identifying peak hours for bike rentals, determining the breakdown of annual subscribers vs. short-term customers, identifying the highest-traffic locations, and analyzing data on bike maintenance to estimate costs. The ultimate goal is to create a strong presentation for potential investors that demonstrates the viability of the bike-share company idea in Des Moines.

## Results:

### Trips Per Weekday (Per Hour)
The flow of data on this visual is consistant with what we know about commuter traffic. Monday through Friday peak hours are centraled around morning and evening rush hour. Weekend peak hours are spread throughout the day as many riders are likely running errands throughout the day.

## Summary: Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional visualizations that you would perform with the given dataset.
A bike share business does well in New York City for several reasons:

* High population density: New York City is one of the most densely populated cities in the world, with millions of people living and working in a relatively small area. This means that there is a large potential customer base for a bike share business.

* Limited parking and traffic congestion: New York City is notorious for its traffic congestion and limited parking options, especially in busy areas like Manhattan. A bike share business can provide a convenient alternative to driving or taking public transportation for short trips, especially during peak traffic hours.

* Bike-friendly infrastructure: In recent years, New York City has made significant investments in building bike lanes and other infrastructure to support cycling. This makes it easier and safer for people to use bikes for transportation.

* Tourist attraction: New York City is a major tourist destination, and many visitors are interested in exploring the city by bike. A bike share business can provide an easy and affordable way for tourists to see the sights and get around.

A bikeshare business may or may not do well in Des Moines, Iowa, depending on several factors:

* Population density: Des Moines is a mid-sized city with a population of around 215,000 people. Compared to larger cities like New York or Chicago, there may be less demand for a bikeshare service in Des Moines due to the lower population density.

* Cycling infrastructure: Des Moines has made some recent investments in building cycling infrastructure, such as bike lanes and trails. However, the city may not be as bike-friendly as other cities that have a more established cycling culture, which could affect the demand for a bikeshare service.

* Weather: Des Moines has a relatively mild climate, but winters can be cold and snowy. This may limit the demand for a bikeshare service during the winter months, which could impact the financial viability of the business.

* Competition: Des Moines already has a number of established transportation options, including public transit, ride-sharing services, and traditional bike rental shops. A bikeshare business may face stiff competition from these existing services.

Overall, a bikeshare business in Des Moines may be successful if there is enough demand for the service, and if the business can differentiate itself from existing transportation options. Providing unique features such as electric bikes, a convenient payment system, and strategically located docking stations could make the business more attractive to potential customers.
